While there is always L<Mojo::JSON> out there, sometimes we need more speed.  L<JSON::XS> is the first thing that comes to mind. But they not only have different interfaces, but also work different with encodings.

[cut]

So here is L<Mojo::JSON::Any>, a tiny wrapper around L<JSON::XS> that has the same interface and works exactly the same as L<Mojo::JSON> with encodings. The tests suite is almost identical.

L<Mojo::JSON::Any> follows the same phylosophie as all Any modules on CPAN do.  When no L<JSON::XS> is available, L<Mojo::JSON> is used. When L<JSON::XS> is available but it use is not desirable C<MOJO_JSON> variable can be set to fall back to using L<Mojo::JSON>. If no variable is set and L<JSON::XS> is available then it is used.

Git repository is on github L<http://github.com/vti/mojo-json-any>.
