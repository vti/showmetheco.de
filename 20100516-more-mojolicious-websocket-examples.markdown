I've been playing with WebSockets for a while. And here are some links to the
projects I've came up with. Server side is written in [Mojolicious::Lite](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Lite).
Client side is mostly JQuery. For non websocket browser Flash workaround is used.

**Showmetheshell**

An interactive shell with colors and unicode support.

Some screenshots are available in the repo:

**Showmethedesktop**

A HTML5 Canvas VNC client.

When implementing this I've also written a Protocol::RFB module. That does the job.

**Showmethedrawing**

A HTML5 Canvas simple colaboration drawing.

**Mojomber**

A simple multiplayer Bomberman clone. Fun to play :)

And BTW, [Mojo::JSON::Any](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo::JSON::Any) speeds up everything.

Enough self advertising for today ;)
