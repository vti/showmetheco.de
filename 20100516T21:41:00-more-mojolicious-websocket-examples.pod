I've been playing with WebSockets for a while. And here are some links to the
projects I've came up with. Server side is written in L<Mojolicious::Lite>.
Client side is mostly JQuery. For non websocket browser Flash workaround is used.

B<Showmetheshell>

An interactive shell with colors and unicode support.

Some screenshots are available in the repo:

B<Showmethedesktop>

A HTML5 Canvas VNC client.

When implementing this I've also written a Protocol::RFB module. That does the job.

B<Showmethedrawing>

A HTML5 Canvas simple colaboration drawing.

B<Mojomber>

A simple multiplayer Bomberman clone. Fun to play :)

And BTW, L<Mojo::JSON::Any> speeds up everything.

Enough self advertising for today ;)
