I've written an article called "Diving into HTML5 with WebSockets and Perl" for
the B<$foo> German Perl Magazine. It was translated of course :) So if you can
read German and want to support a good Perl periodical publication check out
L<http://www.perl-magazin.de/>! English version will be available here the next
week.

Stay tuned!
