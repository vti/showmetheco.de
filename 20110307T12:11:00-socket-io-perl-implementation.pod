Title: Socket.IO Perl implementation
Tags: perl, socket.io

Socket.IO is a universal way to write realtime web apps that work in every
browser. Socket.IO supports several transports that are chosen during runtime
based on the current browser capabilities:

    * WebSocket
    * Adobe® Flash® Socket
    * AJAX long polling
    * AJAX multipart streaming
    * Forever Iframe
    * JSONP Polling

This way it is possible to write WebSocket-like web apps without bothering much
about the vendor support.

Socket.IO has an official client and various (among official) server
implementations in different languages and frameworks. Here is a new Perl
implementation L<http://github.com/vti/plack-middleware-socketio> built on top
of L<Plack> as a normal middleware.
