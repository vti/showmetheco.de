Title: Perl RÃ©sumÃ©
Tags: Perl, dancer, metacpan, fun

Lately I was playing with [http://metacpan.org](http://metacpan.org) api. So I built a simple website that generates your Perl résumé based on CPAN experience, activity and impact. Runs on [Dancer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer) btw.

So check it out [http://perlresume.org](http://perlresume.org)!

Any comments, suggestions and critics are as usual very very welcome.
