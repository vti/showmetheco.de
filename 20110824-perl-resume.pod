Title: Perl Résumé
Tags: Perl, dancer, metacpan, fun

Lately I was playing with L<http://metacpan.org> api. So I built a simple website that generates your Perl résumé based on CPAN experience, activity and impact. Runs on L<Dancer> btw.

So check it out L<http://perlresume.org>!

Any comments, suggestions and critics are as usual very very welcome.
