Title: Little gifts are true
Tags: Perl, gifts

After reading rjbs' post on
[Promoting little gifts](http://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/1906) I remembered
various gifts that I received from the users of my modules. For example I
received a ebook from [Jens Gassmann](https://github.com/jegade) for working on
[PocketIO](http://github.com/vti/pocketio) and today I got a thankful note and a
donation from [http://privytalks.com](http://privytalks.com), the website that uses the same
[PocketIO](http://github.com/vti/pocketio) in
production (scary!). Funny that I can use _something_ that uses _something_ I wrote.

It's always nice to receive thanks and gifts. Thank you!
