Title: PerlWeekly - Quality Perl links
Tags: Perl, subscription

I've joined L<http://perlweekly.com/> as soon as it was launched. And since then
I've enjoyed the quality Perl links every Monday. Not too few, not too many,
just the right amount of news to check if I missed something during the week.

Articles, discussions, videos, events... I wish it had the most interesting CPAN
updates or new Perl projects. Some unique content would be nice too, like
interviews or short stories.
