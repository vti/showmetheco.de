Title: Back from BlackPerl 2011
Tags: perl, blackperl2011

On the first days of October (1-2) I was in
[Crimea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea) (beautiful peninsula on the 
[Black Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea)). There was a beta version
of [BlackPerl](http://black-perl.org) workshop.  We had not many people there
but we had a lot of fun, presentations and even a small hackathon.

[cut] Below are pictures and details

The workshop was organized by [Yaroslav Korshak](http://perlresume.org/YKO) from
[Kiev PM](http://kiev.pm.org) group.

The view from the building was just awesome:

## Setup Day

I wasn't on the first setup day, but the guys were already hacking:

## Day One

On the first day [Yaroslav Korshak](http://perlresume.org/) (aka yko) explained
how to behave, what to say and other stuff that could kick us out from the
workshop:

## Resume

It was a great time: nice people, interesting talks and good weather despite of
October. Hacking together was a useful experience too.

Thanks everybody involved!

and more interesting presentations!
