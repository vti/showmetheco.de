On the first days of October (1-2) I was in
L<Crimea|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea> (beautiful peninsula on the 
L<Black Sea|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea>). There was a beta version
of L<BlackPerl|http://black-perl.org> workshop.  We had not many people there
but we had a lot of fun, presentations and even a small hackathon.

[cut] Below are pictures and details

The workshop was organized by L<Yaroslav Korshak|http://perlresume.org/YKO> from
L<Kiev PM|http://kiev.pm.org> group.

The view from the building was just awesome:

On the first day L<Yaroslav Korshak|http://perlresume.org/> (aka yko) explained
how to behave, what to say and other stuff that could kick us out from the
workshop:
