Title: Reading Perl documentation: perlrun
Tags: perl, documentation

Recently I reread C<perlrun> and found amazing things I didn't know about.
Maybe this can be interesting for somebody else too.

=head2 Tracing Perl script

Something like C<set -x> for bash scripts:

    PERLDB_OPTS="NonStop=1 AutoTrace=1 frame=2" perl -dS ./myscript.pl

=head2 Turn on Unicode

When printing Unicode text on the command line, you don't have to encode it,
just use C<-C> switch:

    perl -C -Mutf8 -e 'print "привет\n"'

=head2 C<-e> can be used multiple times

    perl -e 'print "hello";' -e 'print "\n"'

=head2 Copy files with perl

If you can't use C<cp> you can use perl!

    perl -p -i'/some/file/path/*' -e 1 file1 file2 file3

=head2 Extract Perl script

You received an email and there is a Perl script somewhere, you don't have to
extract it yourself. Let perl do it. By using C<-x> switch perl will try to find
Perl script and will run it.

    Hi,

    here is a Perl script I wrote. Try it.

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    print "Hello world\n";

And then:

    perl -x email.txt

Reading documentation is useful :)
