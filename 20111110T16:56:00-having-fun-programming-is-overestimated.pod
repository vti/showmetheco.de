Title: Having fun programming is overestimated
Tags: programming, fun

A "web framework that makes development fun", a "fun way to program", a "fun
introduction". I am tired of this fun programming. Development shouldn't be fun,
if I want fun I go and play football with my friends.

    Fun is an ephemeral emotion. I feel it right now, it doesn't have deep
    roots. Doesn't really go anywhere, it doesn't feed me in a deep way. It
    feels good, I like having fun... but it's different than joy.

    -- Kent Beck "Ease at Work"

Fun is something that makes you feel happy for a short period of time but
doesn't change you and/or improve your skills. What's the point of fun
programming? Suppose I use a framework, library or a module. Should I have fun
by using it?  No. Instead it should bring a joy by being stable, understandable,
flexible etc.

"Fun" is a bad smell for a project.
