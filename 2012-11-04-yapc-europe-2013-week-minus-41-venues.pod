Title: YAPC::Europe 2013 in Kiev, week minus 41. Venues
Tags: Perl, yapc, yapc::europe, venue

As I am in the org team of the next YAPC::Europe in Kiev, I have some news about
the venues. I have been visiting all the previous selected 7 venues and 2 new
that we found on the way. Not an easy task I should say. So here is my report.

[cut]

=head2 Ukrainian House

=begin html

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/images/venue/ukrdim.jpg" />
</div>

=end html

L<Ukrainian House|http://www.ukrdim.org.ua/> is a nice huge city-centered place,
it has the best view actually. The only downside is price :) We really want to
get this place, so we are trying out different strategies of balancing the
budget.

=head2 MasterClass

=begin html

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/images/venue/masterklass.jpg" />
</div>

=end html

L<MasterClass|http://masterklass.org/eng> is a nice venue near historical
center, but it doesn't have enough space to accept and feed 300 visitors.

=head2 President Hotel

=begin html

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/images/venue/president-hotel.jpg" />
</div>

=end html

L<President Hotel|http://www.president-hotel.com.ua/en/> is one the most
expensive hotels in Kiev, so the price is corresponding. And it's not very easy
to reach with the public transportation.

=head2 Parus Business Center

=begin html

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/images/venue/parus.jpg" />
</div>

=end html

L<Parus Business Center|http://www.parus.biz/> is pretty close to the center
(10-15min walk). When I visited this venue the office manager even asked me
'Perl? Does anyone still program on it?'. I laughed and kindly explained him
that YES, WE DO!

=head2 European University

=begin html

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/images/venue/european-university.jpg" />
</div>

=end html

L<European University|http://www.e-u.in.ua/eng/> is a great place but somewhat
distant from the city center. Also the halls are on different floors.

=head2 Hotel Bratislava

=begin html

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/images/venue/hotel-bratislava.jpg" />
</div>

=end html

L<Hotel Bratislava|http://www.bratislava.com.ua/?lang=en>. Unfortunately I
coudn't see any of the halls, because it was under renovation. Also it is on
another side of the river.

=head2 NSC Olimpiyskiy

=begin html

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/images/venue/nsc.jpg" />
</div>

=end html

L<NSC Olimpiyskiy|http://nsc-olimpiyskiy.com.ua/en/>. This is the main football
stadium in Ukraine. It'd be great to have a conference here, unfortunately is it
overpriced and very dependent on the local football games. We could end up with
canceling the conference.

=begin html

=head2 Hotel Rus

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/images/venue/hotel-rus.jpg" />
</div>

=end html

L<Hotel Rus|http://www.hotelrus.kiev.ua/en.html>. This hotel has a great name.
Rus is the name of the medieval polity in Europe which used to unite many slavic
tribes. And Kiev was the capital. This hotel has a big hall that can be divided
into smaller parts. I like this approach so the attendees won't need to run
between different floors. This was kinda the same on YAPC::Brazil 2012 (what
a great place btw :). It is very close to the Parus Business center.

=head2 M17: Contemporary Art Center

=begin html

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/images/venue/m17.jpg" />
</div>

=end html

L<Contemporary Art Center|http://m17.com.ua/en> has a big hall mainly dedicated
for exibitions. The main downside is that they cannot be divided into parts with
good sound isolation.

=head2 That's it

So this is it. Now we are deciding which one is going to win. Help us decide
using the comment section below.

Thank you!
