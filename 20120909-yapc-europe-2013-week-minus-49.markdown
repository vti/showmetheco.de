Title: YAPC::Europe 2013. Week â49
Tags: Perl, yapc, yapc::europe

As I am in the org team of the next YAPC::Europe in Kiev, I have some good news
for you, fellow Perlers! But first a short note about the venue. We started
going to the every venue (out of 7 selected previously), meeting the people
there, getting all the details we need for choosing the best one. We have
prepared an extensive list of the things that must be present, so we won't
forget anything. As usual, if you have any suggestions what a venue of your
dream must be ping us on [twitter](http://twitter.com/yapcrussia). And now
to the fun part.

So far we have contacted Damian Conway, Larry Wall and Matt S. Trout and asked
if they were interested in attending Kiev. And they kindly agreed! You know
these prominent members of the Perl community! Also Matt will be giving
a closing talk, I am sure you loved them from the previous years.

Kiev is a great place for Perl programmers from
[CIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States) who
couldn't come to previous European Perl conferences due to visa issues or the
distance. A good chance meeting people we know as authors of great software and
books.

This is the end of today's, minus-49-weeks-before-the-conference newsletter. See
you next week. [Follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/yapcrussia).
