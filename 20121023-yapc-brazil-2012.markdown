Title: YAPC::Brazil 2012!
Tags: Perl, yapc, brazil

Yesterday I came back to Kiev from YAPC::Brazil 2012 in Sao Paulo. To say the
trip was great is to say nothing. And of course all the karma goes to
[@garu](http://twitter.com/garu_rj) for hosting us in Rio and taking care of us
in Brazil in general!

Rio is just awesome. Here are some pictures:

My hotel in Sao Paulo wasn't the best one as you can see from the window view:

The conference itself was shared with W3C conference and the organization was
top level. There was even a simultaneous translation into English.

As usual there was a hall dedicated to the cool kids.

I did my talk on the first day. Here are my
[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/vti/working-with-websockets-in-perl). Though
I think I did ok, one of my live demos failed :D But still 2 of 3 were
successful!

I also announced YAPC::Europe 2013 in Kiev. I hope to see people from Brazil.

As you probably already know [rafl](https://metacpan.org/author/FLORA) released
perl-5.17.5 live on the second day of the conference! This was a historical event.

At the end there was garu's Perl quiz. The quiz that blows your mind. My team
got 3 of 10 answers right. The winning team got 5 :)

Some tips for those traveling abroad (and me of course :):

- always have cash in a respectable currency (USD, EUR, etc)
- always check if your CC works in the destination country
- pay more attention to the local hotels
- buy the SIM card ASAP and have important numbers there
- learn some trivial but important phrases

I had a great time and a great company. Once again, thanks garu for having us!
