Crafty integrates with other services through webhooks and post hooks. Github
integration examples are available in
[repository](https://github.com/vti/crafty/tree/master/examples/github).

Crafty is *Docker* ready. Public images are available from the
[Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vtivti/crafty/).

[REST API](https://github.com/vti/crafty#rest-api) allows more fine grained
control and seamless integration with in-house services.

Enjoy!
