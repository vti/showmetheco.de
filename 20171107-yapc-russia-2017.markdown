Title: YAPC::Russia 2017
Tags: Perl, yapc, yapcrussia

On the 4th of November we had YAPC::Russia 2017 in Moscow. This was a 10th
anniversary and it had to be nothing but great!

Long before the conference we wanted to invite somebody special. I had talked
to several people and finally Stevan Little agreed to come to Russia! What a
brave American I must say :)

As for me I went to shamelessly plug my project
[kritika.io](https://kritika.io) and prepared a talk about finding code
duplications in Perl applications on a big scale (text version in English
is coming soon).

[cut] What happened next?

Flying with Aeroflot is ok. The space is a little tight, but the food is the
best I've had on any flight.

The 3rd of November. Moscow airport. 1Â°C. Cold. Especially when you have
nothing but an autumn jacket.

The Aeroexpress train from Sheremetievo airport to the city (not really center
but next to the subway and railway station) is very comfortable and not very
expensive, I always buy a business class for 1000 rub (~15 eur). In 35 minutes
you are there.

The next stop is my hotel. I booked one for two nights for 7800 rub (~115 eur).
Not the best, not the worst, right in the middle. The laminate on the walls was
a bit strange though :D

The next stop is a preparty with Andrew Shitov and Ilya Chesnokov in a busy bar
with burgers and strange beer. Andrew couldn't finish his Tears of Liberty :)

The 4th of November. Time to start the conference!

Here is the venue, looks dark and scary, but it's not!

The organizers did a very good job. Thank you very much!

After the conference we had an afterparty starting from beer and finishing with
wiskey and cognac long after the midnight. The weather wasn't as cold anymore btw :D

The next day on Sunday I wanted to walk a little bit, but almost everything was
closed in the city center, lots of police everywhere. So I ended up going to
GUM and eating/buying some delicious stuff.

It was a great time! See you next year!
